A README should include all installation instructions as well as directions on using the application. For instance, it should tell the app user how to:

cd into the root directory and bundle the project;
run tests;
run any script files in the root directory.

SPECS:
* user selects rock, paper, or scissors
* app throws "rock"
* compares user selection to app selection and returns 'win', 'loss', or 'draw'
* app randomly throws 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'
